	<title>TECHNOLOGY AND YOU</title>
	<text>Computers have become part of your daily lives. We visit shops, offices, and places of scenic beauty with the help of computers. We pay bills prepared by computers. We read newspapers and magazines which have been produced on computers. We receive letters from and send letters to almost every part of the world with the help of computers. And we can even learn foreign languages on computers.

What makes a computer such a miraculous device? Each time you turn it on, with appropriate hardware and software, it is capable of doing almost anything you ask it to. It is a calculating machine which speeds up calculations: it can add, subtract, multiply, and divide with lightning speed and perfect accuracy.

It is an electronic storage device which manages large collections of data. It is a magical typewriter which allows you to type and print any kind of document – letters, memos or requests for leave. It is a personal communicator which helps you to interact with other computers and with people around the world. And if you like entertainment, you can relax by playing computer games or listening to computer-played music.
