	<title>AN EXCURSION</title>
	<text>Dear Minh,
I’m writing to tell you a piece of news. The first term is coming to an end soon and my school is going to have some days off. On this occasion, my class is visiting some caves near Hanoi as we have recently studied rock formations. Besides, many of us have never been inside a cave, so I suppose the trip will be very interesting.

At first we wanted to travel to Thay Pagoda because it is  only over 20 kilometres away, and we could go on a day excursion.
However, only today have we learnt that the caves near Thay Pagoda are closed until after Tet. So we are visiting the ones  near Huong Pagoda instead. A night camp-fire on a two-day trip will be a great event in our schoolday! To make the trip cheap, we are bringing our own food and sharing buses with some other lasses.

It is much warmer now. I believe we’re going to enjoy good weather with lots of sunshine.
The only problem I seem to have is getting my parents’ permission. They may not want to let me stay the night away from home. I’ll try to persuade them.
That’s all for now. Give my love to your parents and sister.

Yours,
Lan
