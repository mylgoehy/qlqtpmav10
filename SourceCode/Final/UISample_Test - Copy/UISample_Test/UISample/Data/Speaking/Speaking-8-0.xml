	<title>The Story Of My Village</title>
	<text>Many year ago, my village was very poor. The village had to work hard in the fields all day and could hardly make ends things. Many people had to live in house make a straw and mud, a few families had radio or TV set. However, in spite of shortages, the villagers managed to send their children to school and college. They hoped that with an education of science and the technology, their children could find a way of bettering their lives.

The children have met their parent’s wishes. When they came back from college or technical high school, they introduced new farming methods, which resulted in bumper crops. They also helped the village grow cash crops for export. Soon, the lifestyle of my village changed. Today, people live in brick house. In the evening, they can listen to the news on the radio or watch TV for entertainment. Sometimes they go to my town on their motorbikes to do some shopping or to visit their friends.

 “Our lives have changed a lot thanks to the knowledge our children brought home,” said an old farmer, “and I alway tell my grandchildren to study harder so that they can do even more for the village than their parents did.”
