	<text>Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam
Cuc Phuong National Park is located 160 kilometres south west of Hanoi. It is the first of Vietnam’s nine national parks to be established, and it contains over 200 squares kilimetres of rainforest. Tourists go there to study butterflies, visit caves, hike mountains and look at the 1000-yer-old tree. The best time to visit the park is during the dry season, from October to April, when the rainy season is over.

Narobi National Park, Kenya
Narobi National Park is Kenya’s smallest park, but you may be surprised at the large variety of animals that live there. Visitors, especially children, can go there to learn how to recognize the different species of animals and plants. They also learn about the habits of animals and how one species is dependent upon another for survival. An interesting feature of this park is the Orphanage, where lots of orphaned or abandoned animals are taken care of.

Everglades National Park, USA
Everglades National Park is a sub-tropical wilderness in the southeastern United States. This national park is special because it has plants and animals from both tropical and temperate zones. Due to an increase in population and the use of nearby land for farming, there are toxic levels of chemicals in the water. This contamination has threatened the park and many of the animals in it.
