	<text>Van Mieu - Quoc Tu Giam is a famous historical and cultural site in Hanoi. Originally built in 1070 in the Ly dynasty, Van Mieu was representative of Confucian ways of thought and behavior. Six years later, Quoc Tu Giam, the first university of Vietnam, was established on the grounds of Van Mieu. Between 1076 and 1779, Quoc Tu Giam educated thousands of  talented men for the country. In 1482, Van Mieu became a place to memorialize the most brilliant scholars of the nation. The names, places of birth and achievements of top students in royal examinations were engraved on stone stelae. These stelae, carried on the backs of giant tortoises, are still standing today and they attract great interest from visitors.

After more than 900 years of existence, Van Mieu is an example of well-preserved traditional Vietnamese architecture. The banyan trees in Van Mieu, which witnessed festivals and examinations during feudal times, continue to flourish. Van Mieu - Quoc Tu Giam is a site of national pride for Vietnamese people.
