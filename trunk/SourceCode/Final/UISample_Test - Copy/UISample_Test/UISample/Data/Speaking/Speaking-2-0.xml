	<title>SCHOOL TALKS</title>
	<text>Hello. My name ‘s Nguyen Hong Phong. I’m sixteen years old. I’m a student at Chu Van An high school. I’m in class 10A with forty-five other students. I study many subjects such as maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Literature, History, Geography, and so on. I like to learn English best because it is an international language. I don’t really like getting up early, but I have to because I often have a lesson at 7: 15.

Hello my name is Nguyen Lan Phuong. I teach English at Chu Van An High School. It is one of the biggest schools in Hanoi. Teaching is hard work, but I enjoy it because I love working with children.

I ‘m Nguyen Hong Ha. I’ m Phong’s father. We live in a small flat above a corner shop in Tay Son Street. The flat is far from Phong’s school so he usually goes to school by bike. I worry about this. He has to ride his bike in narrow and crowded streets to get to school.  There is so much traffic, so many cars motorbikes and bicycles.
