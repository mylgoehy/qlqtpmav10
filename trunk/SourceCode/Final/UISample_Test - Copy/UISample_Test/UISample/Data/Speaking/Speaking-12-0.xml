	<title>MUSIC</title>
	<text>There are two things that make humans different from all other animals. They are language and music. Music is clearly different from language. However, people use it to communicate - especially their emotions. Like reading, writing, and speaking, music can express ideas, thoughts and feelings. It can express ones anger, love, hate, or friendship; it can also convey ones hopes and dreams.

Music is very much an integral part of our life. It is played during almost all important events and on special occasions and sets the tone for them. It adds joyfulness to atmosphere of a festival and makes a funeral more solemn and mournful. Music lulls babies to sleep at night and wakes students up the morning.

Above all, music entertains. It makes happy and excited. It delights the sense. In fact, music as entertainment has always been a big business. It is a billion-dollar industry. It is difficult to imagine what our lives would be like without music.
