	<title>A DAY IN A LIFE OF…</title>
	<text>Mr. Vy : The alarm goes off at 4:30. I get up and go down to the kitchen to boil some water for my morning tea. I drink several cup of tea, have a quick breakfast and then lead the buffalo to the field. It takes me 45 minutes to get ready. I leave the house at the quarter past five and arrive in the field at exactly 5:30. I plough and harrow my plot of land and at a quarter to eight, I take a short rest. During my break, I often drink tea with my fellow peasants and smoke local tobacco. I continue to work from a quarter past eight till 10:30, then I go home, take a short rest and have lunch with my family at 11:30. After lunch I usually take an hour’s rest.

Mrs. Tuyet : At 2:30 in the afternoon we go the field again. We repair the banks of our plot of land. Then my husband pumps water into it while I’m on the transplanting. We work for about two hours before we take the rest. We finish our work at 6 p.m. We have dinner at about 7 p.m., then we watch TV and go to bed at about 10 p.m. Sometimes we go and see our neighbours for a cup of tea. We chat about our work, our children and our plans for the next crop. Although it’s a long day for us,we are contented with what we do. We love working and we love our children.
